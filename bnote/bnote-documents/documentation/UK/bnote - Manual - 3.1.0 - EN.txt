Hardware architecture
b.note is a dual processor system,
It includes a 32-bit microcontroller that manages :
* Power supply system
* The keyboards
* On/Off power button
* USB port,
As a USB braille display, this processor will ensure the good operation of the device.


For the other uses of b.note, a second more powerful processor features :
* Bluetooth,
* Internal applications (files explorer, note-taker, media player)
* Speech synthesis


In needed cases, the second processor switches on. The power supply from the second processor will stop working once the device is turned off (press and hold the power button).
________________


The b.note keys
The On/Off power button                 
The On/Off power button is a key lock that needs to be pulled to be activated.
It allows the device to switch On or Off. A short press leads to “transport” mode. A long press (> to 2 sec.) leads to “stand by” mode. (See “Start up”)
The control keys
b.note is equipped with 2 sets of 4 buttons (keypad of 4 keys)


Functions of the left keypad :
* Press the up key to open the b.note menu,
* Press the down key to enter or exit the current application menu,
* Press the right key to move forward on the braille display,
* Press the left key to move backward the braille display.


Functions of the right keypad :
The 4 buttons are used to simulate the arrow keys. For example, in the menus, the right and left arrow keys enable the selection of the next or previous element of the menu.


A detailed description of the functions of the control keys can be found in chapter “APPENDIX - Controller keyboard shortcuts”.
The routing cursor keys
The routing cursor keys have a double-contact function : a light click on any routing cursor key triggers the first contact, a stronger click will trigger the second contact.


By default, the routing cursor keys functions are the following :
* A light click on the first routing cursor key moves the braille display backward.
* A light click on any routing cursor key moves the braille display forward. When finished reading, the user does not have to look for any particular button or key, he/she presses any routing cursor key to move forward to the next display.
* A stronger click is needed to use the routing cursor key as its usual purpose, like action on an object or positioning the cursor on a text.


The functions assigned to the routing cursor keys can be changed (see APPENDIX “Functions of the routing cursor key”).


The braille keyboard
The braille keyboard of b.note is composed of 8 keys and 2 thumb keys. Each key is related to one braille dot. 
This is how each key is positioned : '7 3 2 1 4 5 6 8'
The 2 thumb keys are named from left to right : '9' and 'A'.


The braille keyboard must be used by pressing and releasing simultaneously one or several keys. The functions or characters generated according to the combination of pressed keys will be detailed later in the document :
* For computer braille, see APPENDIX “8-dot computer braille characters”,
* For the other functions keys (alt, ctrl…) see APPENDIX “10 dots braille functions”
* In order to use the braille keyboard in unimanual mode, see APPENDIX “Unimanual braille keyboard”.

Start Up
The sliding button, located on the left side of the device, needs to be pulled in order to start b.note.
The braille display will switch on and will display the main menu.


Once the device is “on” :
   * A short press turns the device into “transport” mode. In this case, all keys stop working and all dots on the braille display are down.
   * A long press (> to 3 sec) turns the device into sleep mode. The second processor power supply is cut off as well as the braille display. 


After starting up, b.note will display the main menu:
“usb-a usb-b bluetooth-applications nn%”
Choose “usb-a” or “usb-b” to communicate with a computer through the usb cable on one of the 2 serial port emulations. If another internal app or Bluetooth mode is requested, “bluetooth-applications'' will have to be confirmed which will start the second processor of the system.
nn% indicates the percentage of the remaining battery power.
In order to return to the main menu ofb.note , press the up key of the left keypad. 
Once the second processor starts, the main menu is complete :
“usb-a usb-b <List of connected bluetooth channels> <list of documents in editing> explorer settings transport turn off”
Use of a menu
A menu appears as a line of labels.
These labels can be made of several words, in this case the braille dot 8 replaces the space as a word delimiter.
The first label is the menu title, followed by the character “:”
The followed labels are operable buttons separated with spaces.
The braille dot 7 and 8 blink below the first character of the button, meaning the button is focused.
A focused button is activated when pressing 9A from the braille display.
As a shortcut, the buttons of the menus can be activated by typing the shortcut letter when the menu is displayed. The shortcut letter is displayed by the braille dot 8 up and blinking.


When opening a menu, the beginning of the braille display shows the focused object.


There are 2 methods to navigate throughout a menu :
   1. You can either move forward or move backward the braille display on the menu (light click on the routing cursor key, or right and left key of the left keypad), then activate one of the buttons of the menu with a stronger click on the routing cursor key located above this button.
   2. You can move the marking on the different buttons of the menu (left/right key of the right keypad). The focused button is located at the beginning of the braille display, therefore you can activate this button (9A of the braille keyboard).
Use of a dialogue box
A dialogue box shows a list of objects with different values associated, some of these values can be editable. 


A dialogue box is like a menu and can be used the same way. There is a “OK” button to confirm and close it and a “Cancel” button to cancel the modifications. This “Cancel” button is displayed only when modifications are possible in the dialogue boxes.
Just as for the menus, the blinking dots 7 and 8 show the focused element, the raised dot 8 indicates the shortcut letter that will be activated by typing Alt+letter (on the braille keyboard 8A + braille combinaison of the letter).




Besides the buttons, you may find in a dialogue box :
   * text object
   * editable object
   * liste object
“Editable” objects and “list” objects have a name and values associated. They are displayed as “name-value” forms.


“Text” objects have only an informative purpose, any action has no effect. They have no value and will display as “name” form.


Editable objects will enable the modification of a value. Any keyboard action on an editable box will display a blinking braille dots 7-8 under each character to mark selected text. Any character typed on the braille display will replace this value. An action on the editable box will shut editing mode.


The list objects will permit the selection of a value in a defined list, the list will have to be focused and the values, with up/down keys from the right keypad, scrolled.


The main menu of b.note
Two menu versions exist according to the second processor whether it is On or Off.
This chapter describes the first version of the main menu, then the Applications menu in the second version.
USB-A and USB-B
These two buttons permit the use of b.note as a braille display connected via USB serial port.
In this mode, any keyboard action on the keys is sent to the connected device, and the braille display will be refreshed when needed.
Bluetooth-applications
This button will enable you to enter the different applications of b.note, which will start the second processor. 20 seconds later, the main menu becomes the Applications menu.
nn%
This last element indicates the battery power.
The Applications menu of b.note
This menu replaces the main menu when the second processor has started.
To shorten the application menu, the settings application allows you to place most of these applications in the main menu, in a submenu called 'More Apps,' or even make them invisible.
USB
same purpose as the previous menu.
Bluetooth (0 to 4)
The number of the buttons will depend on the number of Bluetooth connections, the text related to these buttons is the name of the Bluetooth system that b.note is connected to. These buttons will allow the connection of the keyboard and the braille display b.note to the Bluetooth system (PC, tablet or smartphone).
If no Bluetooth connection is activated, there is no button of this kind in the menu. 
Document (0 to 5)
These buttons go back to an open document, the text’s name of these buttons is the same as the file name.
When the button start with ‘*-’ it means the document is open in read only mode.
If no document is being edited, there will not be any button in the menu.
Explorer
This button allows the user to launch the file explorer application (See chapter Applications>File explorer).
Settings
This button allows the user to launch the settings ’application (See chapter Applications>Settings).
Transport
Same use as the short press on the On/Off switch of the device (See chapter Start Up). 
Turn Off
Same use as the long press on the On/Off switch of the device (See chapter Start Up). 


The applications
Introduction
The applications of b.note are made of a file explorer, an editor, a settings page.
An Audio application will allow the creation of a playlist to launch audio files.
A Radio application will allow the selection of a radio station and listen to it.
A minesweeper game and a mastermind game can be activated on the “games” parameter from the preferences section. By default, these 2 applications are not visible.


The file explorer
The files explorer presents a list of files and directories included in the current directory. This current directory is  “My documents” from b.note, it can change according to the user’s operation.
Above the base folder 'my documents', a root folder with the elements of the 'go to' menu function is presented. This is an alternative method to this function to go to one of its elements (trash, usb key, etc.). You may use the backspace key to move to the parent directory.




In order to index the different documents, the files explorer has features that will enable it to create/erase subfolders and make copies or operate “directory to directory” transfer.
 
The files can be exchanged by bluetooth with a PC or smartphone or with an USB stick plugged on the USB port. The files explorer can zip and extract archives in zip format.
The explorer has its own menu, see details below.
Introduction and moves in the current directory
The directories and files from the current directory are indexed by alphabetical order.
Each element of this directory relates to a braille line, use the up or down key of the right keypad to navigate throughout this list.


Action on a directory opens it, and it becomes the current directory.
Action on a file opens it in the editor if the format is known (“.txt”, “.mbe”, “.docx”, “xlsx”, “.odt”, “.pdf”, “.brf”, “.rtf”, “.epub”). When the editor opens a file in a format other than “.txt” it converts the file to .txt format and then deletes the converted file. However, the original file can be found in the recycle bin (trash).
Note : The musicxml and the bxml files can be read, played and edited on b.note. You will find another manual that explains how this works.


If you move back the display (left key of the left keypad) it will allow you to see the name of the current directory. A strong click on the routing cursor key located above this name moves to the parent directory. Braille key 9 (backspace) can also be used.


Each element of the directory starts with letters “f” or “d” marking its type (file or directory). A “test.txt” file will be displayed as “f test.txt” and a history directory as “d history”.


after the filename the size is displayed “(x mo)”, “(x ko)”, “(x octets)”.


In this list, characters can be typed,b.note will go on the file or directory that begins with this string, so you might quickly move throughout the list. Once the string is found, it is possible to move to the next one with F3.  
Multiple selection
The file explorer enables the selection of files and directories to cut and copy.


When an element is part of a selection, it will be prefixed with characters “s”. By default, the current element is selected. A file test.txt will be displayed as “sf test.txt”.
When an element is not in the selection, it will be prefixed with characters “n”. A file test.txt will be displayed as “nf test.txt”.


In order to select, press F8 (braille 1259) ; to close a selection, press Esc (braille 1245A).
When the selection is activated, you can switch from one element to another and press Space (braille A) to select/deselect the file/directory displayed.


To select the whole contents of the current directory, you can press the shortcut CTRL+a. 
Trash
When you delete files or directories, they are sent to the trash. You can see the contents of the trash (via menu Directory>trash) and restore a file mistakenly sent to the trash. You can permanently delete files or directories from the trash.


Note : The user has to manage the trash properly, as the trash keeps being filled when deleting documents, the user will have to empty it from time to time.
File explorer menu

________________
The editor
The editor presents the content of a text from a file made of paragraphs.
These paragraphs are segmented in lines of regular characters defined by the user. By default, this number of characters is identical to the braille display device (20, 40, 64 or 80) according to the version).


The edit cursor is represented by the blinking dots 7 and 8 under the next character. Also a selected text is marked with blinking dots 7 and 8.


The “forward / backward” feature of the braille display (right and left  keys from the left keypad or light click on routing cursor) moves the cursor at the beginning of the line only if a text is not selected. This “forward/backward” function enables users to read the selected text.


A keyboard shortcut Ins+F allows users to enter an incremental search mode.
In this mode, you just have to type a sequence of characters and the editor will move to the first occurrence. F3 allows you to move on to the following ones.
If new characters are typed after 1 second they will be interpreted as a new search sequence.
This search is indifferent to accents and the case of characters.
The Escape keyboard shortcut is used to exit this mode.

Educational Games
This set of applications is designed for playful Braille learning. Currently, it includes two applications: "Word Games" and "Calculation Games." They are accessible from the main menu of the B.note.
Word Games
The goal of this game is to reproduce the written word. The display is divided into two parts:
      * The left part with the written word,
      * The right part where the user's input will be displayed.
The record menu:
      * See for this level: Displays the score for the selected level,
      * Clear for this level: Resets the score for the level to 0.
Other options:
      * Go to the next word: Allows you to move on to another word proposal,
      * Change language: Allows you to switch word suggestions from French to English and vice versa,
      * Change level: Allows you to change the level with more or fewer letters,
      * Reset the application: Restores the application to its original state.
Levels
When you first open the application, you will be prompted to choose a level. The levels are divided as follows:
      * The top 4 dots: 1245,
      * The 6 dots: 123456 (no capital letters),
      * The 8 dots,
      * Note: The last level is saved when the device is turned off.
Calculation Games
The goal of this game is to write the result of a calculation. You need to solve operations that can be additions or multiplications.
The game is presented as follows:
      * The operation followed by the equal sign,
      * A blinking cursor to enter the result.
The record menu:
      * See for this table: Displays the score obtained for the selected table,
      * Clear for this table: Clears the score for the selected table.
Other options:
      * Change table: Allows you to choose another operation table,
      * Reset the application: Restores the game to its original state.
Tables
When you first open the application, you need to choose a table. Each table is indicated by a number and the sign of its operation. For example, the multiplication table of 3 will be indicated as "3*" and the addition table of 3 as "3+".
Note: The last table is saved when the device is turned off.
Allow vocal:
      * Auto: Announces the proposal each time and can be repeated by pressing one of the cursors above the example word,
      * Ask: Announces the word only when pressing one of the cursors above the example word,
      * Never: Does not announce the word;
      * Keep spaces: Removes accidental spaces at the beginning or end of a word,
      * Allow mistyping: Allows or disallows the user to enter a character that is not correct.
Note: For the last option, if the user chooses to disable it, they will not be able to move the cursor. At the end of their input, the message will be displayed automatically. If the user leaves this option active, they can move their cursor normally. They will need to press the enter key once the word is typed for the check to be done.
The Timer
This application has both a stopwatch and a timer. During its use, the display indicates the elapsed time and the state (stopped, started, paused).
To start or stop the stopwatch, simply press the enter key or one of the cursors above the status message. When the stopwatch is activated, the displayed values are hours, minutes, and seconds.
You can get the time in hundredths of a second by pausing the stopwatch or by pressing one of the cursors above the elapsed time.
To clear the elapsed time, simply press the backspace key.
Marker Menu
      * Add a marker: Captures the time at the moment of the action and prompts you to enter a name,
      * View markers: Displays a dialog box allowing marker management.
Launch a Timer
To launch a timer, press the option of the same name in the menu bar. Specify the number of hours, minutes, and seconds, then press ok. Once the time has elapsed, you will be automatically redirected to the application, even if you are elsewhere in the B.note.
Marker Management
When you open the marker management box, the list of different captured times is displayed. To find out what name was given to a marker, navigate to it and press "view name." You can rename and delete a marker. When you are done, press "close" or escape.
The games
b.note includes 2 games that can be visible or not, depending on the “visible games” parameter from the preferences section.
Minesweeper
Rules of the game
The objective of the game is to clear a grill containing hidden bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.
The aim of the game is to uncover the empty fields in a minimum of time.
Display and movements
The grid is displayed on the braille display as : 
Line number, grid positions, elapsed time


The position values are as follows :
‘*’ : non-discovered position,
‘ ‘ or a number : Position discovered
‘b’ : position where a bomb has been set


The movements of the cursor, indicated by braille dots 7 and 8 in the grid, are carried out with the right keypad, and the characters can be typed on the braille keyboard as follows :
‘ ‘ : order of the discovery of the position
‘b’ : présence of a bomb in this field
Mastermind
Rules of the game
The objective of the game is to propose a sequence of numbers. The system will respond by indicating the number of existing digits and the number of digits correctly placed in the sequence that needed to be guessed.
The main goal is to find the sequence in a minimum of proposals.


Display and movements
Each proposal is displayed on a line with the result.
You read the different proposals with the top and low keys from the right keypad.
The “Enter” key (b9A) will allow the user to make a new proposal.

b.note with a screenreader
b.note can communicate with another system via a USB connector or Bluetooth.
Its use is not different from any other use of a standard refreshable braille display.


For more information, please go to the screenreader documentation and driver for b.note.


b.note has some distinctive features detailed below.
USB
b.note can be used as an HID keyboard and work independently of the screenreader. Therefore b.note will be able to show any braille combinations or transfer these combinations to the screenreader that will display the matching characters and functions. It will produce 2 entry modes (See APPENDIX - USB Braille keyboard).


Screenreaders Jaws and NVDA work with these features.


For NVDA : On the left keypad, press the down and right keys simultaneously, or press the down and left keys simultaneously, to go from one input method to another.


      * The first mode enables a braille display to perform all keyboard shortcuts with Ctrl+key or Alt+key.
      * The second mode enables the use of grade 2 with NVDA.


Note : a checkbox in NVDA braille settings permits to change this method.


For Jaws : The operating mode is in the driver’s file "Program File/Freedom Scientific/Jaws2020/Driver/Braille/esysiris/eurobraille.ini" the name of the parameter is UseHidKeyboard=0 ou 1.


Bluetooth
Bluetooth can be used to connect b.note to a screenreader and transfer files between b.note and a Windows computer or any Android system (See APPENDIX “Pairing Bluetooth” and “Bluetooth files transfer”).
________________


APPENDIX - Editor - Search
The search for a string of characters in the editor can be done by scrolling down the document (F3), or scrolling up the document (Shift + F3).


Several parameters can refine the search :
      * Ignore character case: If Yes, an alphabetical character is identified whatever the character case is (upper/lowercase)
      * Hide accents : If Yes, a character is identified whatever the accentuation is, therefore é, è ê, ë and e become the same character.
      * Entire word : If yes, only the complete words are identified in the search string.


APPENDIX - Editor - Math.
Description
b.note editor allows calculating math paragraphs.


One Paragraph must include only one math expression; you must not mix text and math expressions.


The calculating functions are available in the math menu in the editor. 


You may write the math expressions in a computer Braille language or in BEU (Braille English Unified) described below.


Your paragraph should start by dot Braille 6 then dot Braille 2 to be recognized as math in computer braille or by dot Braille 56 then dot Braille 56 as math in BEU.


If you use several paragraphs each of them will start with a braille mathematical sequence (b6, b2 or b56,b56).
Math UEB language (Unified English Braille)
Generalities
Spaces are not significant.


Only lowercase characters are allowed.


The result of the calculation is stored in the “r” variable. so you may chained the calculations using this variable.


For statistical functions you can define values enumeration.

Math computer braille language
Generality
Spaces are not significant.


The uppercase character will be converted to lowercase before analysis.


Numbers may be typed as 10 exponents.
Example, 2000 is 2e3 and 0.02 is 2e-2.


Any character not a command will be detected as a variable then 2a will be detected as 2 times the “a” variable if the variable was defined in the previous paragraph.
You may type
a=2
2a
You have 4 after calculation. 


The result of the calculation is stored in the “r” variable. so you may chained the calculations using this variable.


If the variable has more than 1 character you must use the block label {}.
Exemple toto variable is written {toto}


For statistical functions you must use the parenthesis block and the semicolon to separate each value.
Example : (12; {titi}=(3 - 1) (2 + 1); 45; 1+2; 55)

APPENDIX - USB braille keyboard
When the device is connected via USB, the characters and functions of the braille keyboard can be sent in different ways :
      * USB-HID : The characters and functions are produced the same way as the usual USB keyboard. They can be independent of the operating system or the screenreader used.
      * Driver: The characters and functions are being sent to the screenreader’s driver. They are definitely dependent on the screenreader used.
The screenreader or the software communication of b.note can be used to turn an operating mode into another. However, it is possible to acknowledge the operating system you are in or change it manually in the menu.
________________
APPENDIX - Unimanual braille keyboard 
The braille keyboard has different operating modes that you can select in the menu Applications settings keyboard>braille.


Standard :
Anytime you take your fingers off the braille keyboard, the braille combination displayed is the last one typed. However, it is possible to change a combination before releasing the keyboard by changing the pressed keys and waiting a moment before taking your fingers off the full combination.


Unimanual 1 :
You type the braille dots by several successive or combined presses on the keys, then approve this number of presses with the braille key A.
If the A braille key is part of the braille combination, it will have to be typed in combination with another dot, then re-press to approve the combination.


Unimanual 2 :
It is a faster operating mode as the approval of the code is automatic.
The braille display is divided in 2 parts, one part 1,2,3,7,9 and the other part 4,5,6,8,A. You only need to type the first part of the braille combination in one or several presses, then you type just once the second part, and the braille combination will be generated.
For braille combinations that only have dots in one part, you need to press the A braille key to approve.


Unimanual 3 :
This operating mode enables to enter the braille combination using half of the left keyboard part (dots 1,2,3,7). After typing this combination, the second half is typed as follows 1-4, 2-5, 3-6, 7-8, 9-A.
The “A” and “9” keys typed with one half, are taken into account as they are.
The “9” or “A” keys are used to produce Correction or Space but also to approve the braille combinations that do not have the other half.
The “4” key alone permits the typing of the braille combinations that do not have the first half.


Unimanual 4 :
This operating mode is the same as the previous one but using dots 4,5,6,8,A. In order to type the first half of the combination, we will use the following combination 4-1, 5-2, 6-3, 8-7 and A-9. The braille key 1 will permit the typing of the braille combinations without the first half.




APPENDIX - Functions of the routing cursor keys
Multiple keyboard actions are possible on routing cursor keys:
      * Light click (first contact)
      * Stronger click (second contact)
      * 2 successive light clicks (double click first contact)
      * 2 successive stronger clicks (double click second contact)
      * Click on 2 adjacent routing cursor keys


A different function can be assigned to each of these actions. By default, the functions will be as follow :


Actions
	Functions by default
	Light click on the first routing cursor keys
	Moving back the braille display
	Light click on any routing cursor keys 
	Moving forward the braille display
	Strong click
	Action at the current position
	2 successive light clicks
	Same function as double click with the mouse. In a text it can select a word for example
	2 successive strong clicks
	Same function as double click with the mouse. In a text it can select a word for example
	Click on 2 adjacent routing cursor keys 
	Contextual Menu (for screen readers)

APPENDIX - Bluetooth pairing
The bluetooth pairing of a device with b.note is quite simple :


This bluetooth pairing must be done only once. The device saves a list of paired peripherals.
Pairing with a PC
      * Start b.note and select “bluetooth-applications” in the main menu.
      * Activate Bluetooth of the PC you want to pair. Then launch a search for a peripheral. b.note must appear under the name “Esys-bnote-xxxxx”.
      * Launch the pairing by approving the device on the PCl. A serial port is open (COMn on a PC), this port will be used by the screenreader.
      * Then you can make your b.note invisible if you want.
Pairing with a tablet or an Android smartphone
      * Start b.note and select “bluetooth-applications” in the main menu.
      * Activate Bluetooth on the tablet, to do so, go to Settings>Connection of the device and select Bluetooth.
      * In the list of available devices, you must see b.note appear under the name “Esys-bnote-xxxxx”. You must press to launch the pairing.
      * “Esys-bnote-xxxxx” goes to the list of devices associated.
      * Then you can make your b.note invisible if you want.


Pairing with an Apple tablet or smartphone
      * Start b.note and select “bluetooth-applications” in the main menu.
      * on your Apple product go to parameters / accessibility / voice over / braille
      * In the list of available devices, you must see b.note appear under the name “Esys-bnote-xxxxx”. You must press to launch the pairing.
      * “Esys-bnote-xxxxx” goes to the list of devices associated.
      * Then you can make your b.note invisible if you want.






APPENDIX - Bluetooth file transfer
Transfer from PC to b.note
      * Check if your b.note is visible in Bluetooth (menu settings>bluetooth in the file explorer of b.note).
      * Open the Windows files explorer on your PC.
      * Open the contextual menu on the selected file (right click on the mouse) and select “Send to > Bluetooth peripheral”. You can also select a group of files.
      * Pick Esys-bnote in the list of proposed devices then click Next.


Once received, the file is located in a directory named “bluetooth” on b.note.
This location is dedicated to receiving files, so it is necessary to move the files received in a directory of your choice in order to open the file with the editor.
It is recommended to keep the directory “My documents/bluetooth” empty because if there is a file in this directory with the same name, it will lead to transfer failure.


Note:
Sending the file is also accessible with Windows by pressing the Bluetooth icon on the notification bar (systray). After picking the Bluetooth peripheral, the files will have to be selected to be sent.
Transfer from b.note to PC
●      Go to the file explorer of b.note
●      Select the file you want to transfer. It is also possible to select several files for a grouped mailing.
●      Select the function of the menu File>Send to.
●      Pick the computer’s name that needs to receive the file (from the list of peripherals).
●      A dialogue box indicates you need to turn the PC into files inbox mode. On the PC, click on the Bluetooth icon from the notification bar and pick “Receive a file”. Then click Ok on b.note device to launch the transfer.


Once the transfer is done, a dialogue box “Save as” opens on the PC, it allows you to choose the directory where you want the received file to be saved.


Note : If a directory or several files are selected for a grouped mailing, a zipped file (.zip) will be sent to the PC. This file will be named after the first selected file.
Transfer from an Android tablet (or smartphone) to b.note
Check that b.note is visible in Bluetooth (menu settings>bluetooth in the file explorer of b.note).
Bluetooth on the tablet (or smartphone) must be activated, then pair it to the braille device (by clicking on the peripheral listed in “Available devices”).
The file will be sent when the file via Bluetooth is shared and your braille device in the list is selected.
Transfer from b.note to an Android tablet (or smartphone)
      * Go to the file explorer of b.note.
      * Select the file you want to transfer. It is also possible to select several files for a grouped mailing.
      * Select the function of the menu File>Send to.
      * Select the computer’s name in the list of peripherals that need to receive the file.
      * A dialogue box indicates you need to turn the PC into files inbox mode, click Ok to ignore this dialogue box and launch the transfer.
      * A file transfer notification opens on your tablet / smartphone, then you need to accept the transfer.


Once the transfer is done, the file will be placed in “Files received”.


Note : If a directory or several files are selected for a grouped mailing, a zipped file (.zip) will be issued. This file will be named after the first selected file.

APPENDIX - 10 dots braille functions 
      * These combinations are used to generate all keys of a PC keyboard, other than the characters. They are also called bramigraphs. Graph means that the braille dots used to generate any keyboard action, usually have a graphical logic to have a better understanding.
Examples :
      * The “Home” function, that is used to go to the beginning of the line in the editing zone, or at the beginning of a list, can be done by using combination b123A, (dots 1 2 3 at the same time as Space button). Its symmetrical function, end, that is used to go to the end of a line in the editing zone, or at the end of a list, can be done by using symmetrical braille dots, using space as b456A (dots 4 5 6 at the same time as Space button).


      * The 4 arrow keys can also be generated with 10 dots braille functions. Even though they can be used with the right keypad, it is more convenient to generate them this way with successive shortcuts. You can notice that the 4 arrow keys always use the A key (space), combined with one of the 4 dots of the letter “w” in braille (b2456). The up arrow key will use the top dot of “w”, so you will type b4A ; the down arrow key will use the left dot of “w”, you will type b2A ; and the right arrow key will be b5A.
      * The functions from F1 to F12 will be generated when using the first 12 letters of the alphabet in combination with braille key 9, for example b19 for F1 up to b1239 for F12.
